# Search Fore Golf - Project 1

# Description:

Description of project: This project tasked us with making a web application from scratch and execute a design that solves a real-world problem using multiple server-side API requests.  Our team decided to create a web application that allows the user to search for golf courses and be displayed information for each course. We also wanted to integrate the current weather for the search location and have dyanmic weather displayed in the background.  We worked collaboratively to design this application to implement the features and to solve any merge conflicts and bug fixes.

## Completed Tasks

* We had to utilize at least two server-side APIs.  We choose to use [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) to get the golf course data and [Openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for the weather data.

* We were tasked to use a CSS Framework other than Bootstrap.  Our team choose to utilize [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) for the CSS framework.

* We had to use client side storage to store persistent data. We used local storage to handle storing the users favorite golf courses.

* We had to present a polished UI which I feel we accomplished.

* We meet good quality coding standards which included:
    
    * Proper Indentation
    
    * Scoping

    * Naming

    * Proper and detailed comments in the code

* We could not use alerts, confirms, or prompts.

* The application is deployed to GitHUb Pages for viewing.

* Finally, we made the application interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
